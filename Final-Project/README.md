# ClassSpotlight: Our website for the CSE 3901 Final Project

## Description:
ClassSpotlight is a website that allows teachers to create presentation events for their classes, for which they and students can submit evaluations. To achieve this, ClassSpotlight first prompts the user with a signup/login page. A user can sign up as either a teacher or as a student. Teachers can then create a new course, and then add students (who must have ClassSpotlight accounts) to the course using their emails in the Class Roster page. With the course set up, the teacher can create a new event for a presentation, representing a presentation held in class. The teacher and the students can then submit evaluations for the presentation, and allow the presenting student to see their feedback.
